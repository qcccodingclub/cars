		<h1>SuperCars</h1>
		<p>A supercar is one of the highest classes for cars. These cars are typically the best of the best, and are in extremely limited quantities. A supercar has a certain mystique associated with it. They are usually limited to a certain amount of vehicles built, that way there is some type of exclusivity to own one.</p>

		<h1>Classic Cars</h1>
		<p>Age is one of the primary factors that determine the value of a classic car. In general, the older the classic car is, the higher it would be priced in the market. This means that an older classic car would have a higher price tag than a classic car which is of the same model but newer.</p>
