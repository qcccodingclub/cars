				<p>BMW’s logo consists of initials for Bavarian Motor Works. The white and blue chequered roundel represents the flag of Bavaria while the black exterior circle is derived from the logo of BMW’s predecessor – Rapp. It is also believed that the chequered blue and white roundel represents the blades seen in older aircrafts.</p>

				<h3 class="card-header">FERRARI</h3>
				<img src="https://moneyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ferrari-Logo-750x469.jpg">
				<p>Ferrari has one of the most recognisable logos in the automobile industry. The Italian flag sits right at the top of the logo while below it is yellow shield, signifying the colour of Modena. The logo also bears the initials ‘SF’ which translate to Scuderia Ferrari or Team Ferrari, and the very well-known black prancing horse. Interestingly, the horse was chosen by Enzo Ferrari because of the late son (Francesco Baracca) of a count he had met. Baracca was fighter ace in the First World War and had a horse painted on the fuselage of his fighter aeroplane. Baracca’s mother had advised Enzo Ferrari to use the horse for his cars, as it would bring good luck. The horse is said to have been taken from a German Pilot, shot down by Baracca, from Stuttgart.</p>

				<p>Elon Musk’s Tesla is named after the designer of the alternating current electricity system, Nikola Tesla. Infact, the first model by the brand, the Roadster, had a motor which was descended from Tesla’s original design. The ‘T’ seen on the logo signifies a cross section of an electric motor. The upright part represents a rotor pole while the curved line over the top symbolizes a stator.</p>

				<p>Mercedes-Benz, a marque known all around the world for its luxurious cars also has an interesting story behind its name and logo. Part of the name came from the daughter of Emil Jellinek, Daimler’s partner. The other came from Karl Benz, the man responsible with making the first car. When the two came together in 1926, Mercedes-Benz was born. The famous three pointed star comes from a postcard sent by Gottlieb Daimler to his wife which said that he was living in a three pointed star and that ‘one day this star will shine over our triumphant factories.’ The three points are mean to signify land, sea and air and was first seen on a car in 1910.</p>
